# TSP
The Traveling Salesman implmentation in Rust

This algorithm uses a exponential time complexity O(2^n) to solve The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

The purpose of the this algorihtm is to find the shortest path that someone can travel and return to the same city of origin without going back to any point he already was before. It is typically formulated as a decision problem and is known to be NP-hard, which means that there is no known algorithm that can solve all instances of TSP in polynomial time unless P = NP, which is an unresolved question in computer science.

P = NP
---
The statement "P = NP" is one of the most famous and long-standing unsolved problems in computer science and mathematics. It is a fundamental question in the theory of computational complexity and has profound implications for various areas of computer science, cryptography, and optimization.

In computational complexity theory:

- P stands for "polynomial time," which refers to the class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. In simpler terms, these are problems for which there exists an algorithm that can find a solution in a time frame that grows at most as a polynomial function of the problem size.

- NP stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time," which refers to the class of decision problems for which a proposed solution can be checked for correctness in polynomial time. In other words, if someone claims to have a solution to an NP problem, you can verify whether their solution is correct relatively quickly.
